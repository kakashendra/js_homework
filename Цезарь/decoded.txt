what was that taskz what was it that tolstoy zwanted to expressz in his book, which he deliberately does not call a novelz boris de schloezer, a fine critic and philosopher, wrote in the preface to his french translation of war and peace (1960) that tolstoyzs one aim, from the beginning, was zto speak the truthz as perceived by his eye and his conscience. zall the forces of his imagination, his power of evocation and expression, converge on that one single goal. outside any other religious or moral considerations, tolstoy when he writes obeys one imperative, which is the foundation of what one might call his literary ethic. that imperative is not imposed on the artist by the moralist, it is the voice of the artist himself.z as early as the sketch zsevastopol in mayz of 1855, tolstoy had asserted, zmy hero is truth.z in war and peace he wanted to speak the truth about a certain period of russian lifezthe period of the napoleonic wars of 1805 to 1812. he wanted to say, not how that period could be made to appear in a beautiful lie, an entertaining or instructive story, a historical narrative, but how it was. he wanted to capture in words what happened the way it happened. but how does happening happenz how can words express it without falsifying itz how can one capture the past once it is pastz these were questions that tolstoy constantly brooded on. he had already posed them for himself in 1851, in his very first literary work, the fragment za history of yesterday.z the composition of war and peace was his fullest response to them.
